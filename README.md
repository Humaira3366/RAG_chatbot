A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to build a chatbot that can answer user questions based on uploaded PDF content without needing OpenAI API keys. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

PDF Upload & Extraction

The user uploads a PDF via the Streamlit UI.

The text is extracted using PyPDF.

Text Chunking & Embedding

The extracted text is split into manageable chunks.

Each chunk is converted into a vector (embedding) using a SentenceTransformer model like all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

Vector Database (FAISS)

All vectorized chunks are stored in a FAISS vector store for fast similarity search.

User Query Processing

When a user enters a query, it is also embedded and matched against the FAISS store to retrieve the most relevant chunks.

Answer Generation (RAG)

The retrieved chunks and the userâ€™s query are passed to a local LLM (DeepSeek model via Ollama) for answer generation.

Response Display

The generated answer is displayed back to the user on the Streamlit app interface.
